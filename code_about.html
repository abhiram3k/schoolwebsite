  <h3>About Us:</h3>
  <p>Bhashyam started its historic journey in 1986 with the inception of a Girls High School at Vijayawada. And since then there has been no turning back. The inception of Sri Chaitanya Educational Institutions was the result of a vision rather than the mere setting up of an institution. Our Founders and Mentors, Dr. B. S. Rao garu and Dr. Jhansi Lakshmi Bai garu, were hugely successful in the medical profession and decided to look at a fresh approach to Intermediate level education. A systematised methodology was introduced that changed the very face of education in Andhra Pradesh, for the better. A fresh chapter in the Pre-university stream of education in the state began with the introduction of a more professional approach to teaching and staff management.</p>
  <p>The growth of Sri Chaitanya – post 1986, has been phenomenal and part of folk-lore. A Boys’ Junior college(1991), branches in Hyderabad (1996), Visakhapatnam (1998), Tirupathi and Guntur (2000), Eluru, Bhimavaram, Rajahmundhry, Kakinada and Machilipatnam (2002), Tenali, Ongloe, Srikakulam, Amalapuram, Chittoor, Nellore and Ananthapur (2003) in Andhra Pradesh.</p>
  <p>Bhashyam continued its march forward by stepping beyond the state. Branches were opened in Delhi (2004), Hamirpur-Himachal Pradesh (2005) and Bellary – Karnataka. In 2006, the institution opened IIT-JEE / AIEEE / PMT Coaching Centres at Mandi-Himachal Pradesh, Ranchi and Bokaro – Jarkhand and Indore Madhya Pradesh. The Group continued its march forward with the inception of Sri Chaitanya Techno Schools in various districts of AP in 2008, and expanding to cover fourteen districts of the     state and 3 districts of Karnataka including four branches in Bangalore by 2011.</p>

  <h3>About Our Founder:</h3>
  <p>Mr. Ramakrishna comes to school daily. He comes to learn. His subjects are students' needs, their hurdles and their fears and doubts. His teachers are the experiences and the outcome of every single issue. In his words, "Education begins the day you think you've not learnt anything". We can only say - happy learning.
  "I always believe and keep telling my students that a positive attitude will take you to great altitudes. The intention to contribute to the development of the society is primary. The action will naturally be reciprocal. Bhashyam was born with a strong commitment for a social renaissance, the parents and well wishers took the movement forward."</p>
  <p>This proactive approach has resulted in creating many vistas for learning and setting up different verticals in the field of education to suit the varying needs of the students.
  Scouting develops self- knowledge and the need to explore, to discover world beyond the classroom tapping the skills of others to learn and to become well rounded people. Through recreation, we at Bhashyam Blooms are trying to achieve it’s purpose of developing young people physically, intellectually, socially and spiritually with the help of Scouts and Guides on 7th and 8th of February in the school premises.
